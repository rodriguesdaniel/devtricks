1) in your dashboard, go to settings -> general and make sure

a) wordpress directory -> http://mydomain.com/wp

b) site address -> http://mydomain.com

2) move your index.php from subdirectory to the root (MOVE, don't just copy)

3) edit your index.php to read

    /** Loads the WordPress Environment and Template */
    require('./wp/wp-blog-header.php');
where "wp" is your subdirectory

4) delete any .htaccess file in the subdirectory

5) add this to your .htaccess in the root

# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress
Under this setup, your wordpress installation will be located in /wp/ directory. Visitors will visit your site using http://mydomain.com.
